# CrossWorlds

The CrossWorlds Project for IBM Domino and OpenNTF ODA brings together:

- OpenNTF Domino API
- WebSphere Liberty

## Documentation
See https://wiki.openntf.org/display/CW/

For an introduction: http://www.slideshare.net/DanieleVistalli/introducing-crossworlds-for-ibm-domino

because of licensing issues around re-distribution of third-party code, users need to build the functioning Websphere Liberty feature themselves, following the instructions at https://wiki.openntf.org/display/CW/Setup
